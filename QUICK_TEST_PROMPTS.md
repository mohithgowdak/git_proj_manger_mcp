## 🎯 Replace Placeholders

When you see `[PROJECT_ID]`, `[ISSUE_ID]`, or `[SPRINT_ID]`, replace them with actual IDs from your repository. You can get these by:
- Running "List all GitHub projects" first
- Creating items and noting their IDs from the response
- Using the GitHub web interface to find IDs

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Test in Order**: Run prompts 1-5 in sequence to build up test data
2. **Check Responses**: Each prompt should return success/error messages
3. **Verify in GitHub**: Check your GitHub repository to confirm items were created
4. **Use Real Data**: Replace placeholders with actual IDs from your repository
